# Hash Table

We can explain everything with a visual and example.

Example: Price of products in the supermarket.

"apple,3", "pear,7" 

If I only use arrays it would be a waste of my time so we will use *Hash Table*.

Alright, How do we use the hash table?

+ First we will create an array where the number of elements is equal.
+ We will enter the name of the products into the function as input, we will take the function result as the index of the array.

> [!NOTE]
> This function is called hash function and Hash Function + Arrays = Hash Table


To give an example: Function input: apple and output (array index: 3)

Well function outputs == array indexes


Let's give an illustrated example:

*Key 4 = apple* and after function operation *(value 4)apple = (index) 3*.

Summary:

+ The function uses the index of the arrays as labels.
+ Arrays provided fixed-time access
